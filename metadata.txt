description=Advanced segmentation tool with intelligent SAM 2.1/Ultralytics SAM2.1_B selection, exceptional CPU performance (<1s on 24+ cores), GPU acceleration, threading, and professional workflow features
about=GeoOSAM brings Meta's latest Segment Anything Model (SAM 2.1) and Ultralytics SAM2.1_B to QGIS with intelligent hardware optimization. Features automatic model selection: SAM 2.1 for GPU systems (CUDA/Apple Silicon) and Ultralytics SAM2.1_B for CPU-only systems, providing 5-10x performance improvements. Ultralytics automatically handles SAM2.1_B downloads for seamless CPU setup. Includes GPU/CPU acceleration with automatic device detection, multi-threaded processing for responsive UI, Point and BBox segmentation modes, 12 pre-defined classes (Buildings, Roads, Vegetation, Water, Vehicle, Ship, etc.) plus custom class creation, Undo functionality for mistake correction, Custom output folder selection, Optional debug mask saving, Automatic raster layer re-selection, Professional shapefile export with detailed attributes. Perfect for remote sensing analysis, urban planning, environmental monitoring, and geospatial segmentation tasks. Optimized for NVIDIA GPU, Apple Silicon, and multi-core CPU processing with intelligent model selection for optimal performance on any hardware.
